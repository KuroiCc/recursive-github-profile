## How to use

1. Clone this repo and `npm install`
2. `npm install -g .`
3. Have github profile pages set up (i.e. create a repo called `your-username` and ensure it is appearing on your repo by clicking the button that appears when you push it)
4. Set up a base case by publishing a `README.md`
6. in your profile repo run `recursive-github -u <your username> -d <depth of the recursion>`
7. Done!
